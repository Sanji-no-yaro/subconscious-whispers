# Whispering Between Realms: A Journey Through Dreams and Self-Discovery

🧠✨ This is a personal short book that explores the connection between our dreams, subconscious thoughts, and inner dialogue. It’s a raw and honest reflection on fear, growth, and self-awareness—written from real experiences and dreams I've had.

📘 The book is for anyone who’s ever wondered about the meaning behind their dreams or talked to themselves in silence, trying to make sense of their world.
